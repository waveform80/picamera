# At this point we now have the raw Bayer data with the correct values
# and colors but the data still requires de-mosaicing and
# post-processing. If you wish to do this yourself, end the script here!
#
# Below we present a fairly naive de-mosaic method that simply
# calculates the weighted average of a pixel based on the pixels
# surrounding it. The weighting is provided by a byte representation of
# the Bayer filter which we construct first:

bayer = np.zeros(rgb.shape, dtype=np.uint8)
bayer[1::2, 0::2, 0] = 1 # Red
bayer[0::2, 0::2, 1] = 1 # Green
bayer[1::2, 1::2, 1] = 1 # Green
bayer[0::2, 1::2, 2] = 1 # Blue

# Allocate an array to hold our output with the same shape as the input
# data. After this we define the size of window that will be used to
# calculate each weighted average (3x3). Then we pad out the rgb and
# bayer arrays, adding blank pixels at their edges to compensate for the
# size of the window when calculating averages for edge pixels.

output = np.empty(rgb.shape, dtype=rgb.dtype)
window = (3, 3)
borders = (window[0] - 1, window[1] - 1)

rgb = np.pad(rgb, [
    (border[0], border[0]),
    (border[1], border[1]),
    (0, 0),
    ], 'constant')
bayer = np.pad(bayer, [
    (border[0], border[0]),
    (border[1], border[1]),
    (0, 0),
    ], 'constant')

# For each plane in the RGB data, we use a nifty numpy trick
# (as_strided) to construct a view over the plane of 3x3 matrices. We do
# the same for the bayer array, then use Einstein summation on each
# (np.sum is simpler, but copies the data so it's slower), and divide
# the results to get our weighted average:

for plane in range(3):
    p = rgb[..., plane]
    b = bayer[..., plane]
    pview = as_strided(p, shape=(
        p.shape[0] - borders[0],
        p.shape[1] - borders[1]) + window, strides=p.strides * 2)
    bview = as_strided(b, shape=(
        b.shape[0] - borders[0],
        b.shape[1] - borders[1]) + window, strides=b.strides * 2)
    psum = np.einsum('ijkl->ij', pview)
    bsum = np.einsum('ijkl->ij', bview)
    output[..., plane] = psum // bsum

# At this point output should contain a reasonably "normal" looking
# image, although it still won't look as good as the camera's normal
# output (as it lacks vignette compensation, AWB, etc).
#
# If you want to view this in most packages (like GIMP) you'll need to
# convert it to 8-bit RGB data. The simplest way to do this is by
# right-shifting everything by 2-bits (yes, this makes all that
# unpacking work at the start rather redundant...)
